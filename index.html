        Brown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia.[3] He rose
        to prominence in the mid-1950s as the lead singer of the Famous Flames,
        a rhythm and blues vocal group founded by Bobby Byrd.[4][5] With the hit
        ballads "Please, Please, Please" and "Try Me", Brown built a reputation
        as a dynamic live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band,
        sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra.
        His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo
        and hit singles such as "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag", "I Got You (I Feel
        Good)" and "It's a Man's Man's Man's World". During the late 1960s,
        Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles
        to a new approach to music-making, emphasizing stripped-down
        interlocking rhythms that influenced the development of funk music.[6]
        By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the
        formation of the J.B.s with records such as "Get Up (I Feel Like Being
        a) Sex Machine" and "The Payback". He also became noted for songs of
        social commentary, including the 1968 hit "Say It Loud â€“ I'm Black and
        I'm Proud". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from
        pneumonia in 2006.
